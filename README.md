# Set scripts for installation programs on Fedora linux

Folder "filesForInstallFromMainFile" contains files, which must be executed from the main script.

If you wanna execute some file with sudo, set the file name starting with "sudo_", else without it.

In the end execute file "main\.sh" with sudo and enjoy the process.
